#### Bug fixes

 - In BPF mode, fix handling of node ports that redirect to host networked pods in AWS. [felix #2631](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2631) (@fasaxc)
 - Mark aws-src-dst-check report ready when successful. This fix addresses the issue with calico-node not being ready in EKS setup using Calico CNI. [felix #2604](https://github.com/projectcalico/felix/pull/2604) (@fasaxc)
 - All components that use Typha now use the same logic to discover Typha's address.  They lookup the endpoints of the service directly and connect to one at random.  This avoids a dependency on kube-proxy. [typha #466](https://github.com/projectcalico/typha/pull/466) (@fasaxc)
 - kube-controllers runs a non-root by default [kube-controllers #566](https://github.com/projectcalico/kube-controllers/pull/566) (@caseydavenport)
