There are many ways to try out {{site.prodname}} with OpenStack, because OpenStack
is a sufficiently complex system that there is a small industry
concerned with deploying it correctly and successfully.

You can install {{site.prodname}} via any of the following methods:

- [Package-based install for Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty) or 16.04
  (Xenial)]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/getting-started/openstack/installation/ubuntu)

- [RPM-based install for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (RHEL
  7)]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/getting-started/openstack/installation/redhat)

- [DevStack]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.version}}/getting-started/openstack/installation/devstack) (for development purposes only â€” not recommended for production!)

In all cases, except DevStack, you will need at least two or three servers to
get going: one OpenStack controller and one or more OpenStack compute nodes.

## Target platforms and OpenStack releases

We aim to develop and maintain the Neutron driver for {{site.prodname}}
(networking-calico) so that its master code works with OpenStack master or any
previous release (back to Icehouse), on any OS platform, and independently of
the deployment mechanism that is used to install it.

That said, we recommend using OpenStack Liberty or later, on Ubuntu Trusty or
Xenial, or RHEL/CentOS 7, as those are the platform combinations that are used
in most of our own testing, and by many third party {{site.prodname}} users.

## Nova patch needed with Mitaka and earlier

With OpenStack Mitaka and earlier, and if your libvirt is >= 1.3.3 and < 3.1,
you will need to patch the Nova code post installation, on each compute host,
as in [this change](https://review.openstack.org/#/c/411936/).  In case you
need the same Nova code to work with all possible libvirt versions, you should
then add [this further change](https://review.openstack.org/#/c/448203/).
OpenStack Newton and later already include these two changes.
